It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Zero config
Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.

## Snapshots
Make tests which keep track of large objects with ease. Snapshots live either alongside your tests, or embedded inline.

## Isolated
Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance.

## Great api
From it to expect - Jest has the entire toolkit in one place. Well documented, well maintained, well good.

## Fast and safe

By ensuring your tests have unique global state, Jest can reliably run tests in parallel. To make things quick, Jest runs previously failed tests first and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take.

## Code coverage

Generate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage. No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.

## Easy mocking

Jest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests, making it simple to mock any object outside of your testâ€™s scope. You can use mocked imports with the rich Mock Functions API to spy on function calls with readable test syntax.

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

Jest makes testing delightful.

## Steps to configure Jest in angular project

Step 1: Uninstall all karma jasmine packages
sudo npm uninstall @types/jasmine jasmine-core karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage karma-jasmine karma-jasmine-html-reporter
Step 2: Remove test object from angular.json
Step 3: Delete karma.conf.js file and test.ts file
Step 4: sudo npm i jest @types/jest jest-preset-angular
Step 5: Create setup.jest.ts file
Step 6: Update tsconfig.spec.json file
Step 7: Add jest configuration in package.json
Step 8: Add scripts in package.json to run JEST
